    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Phillip Mendon√ßa-Vieira.</p>
    <p>
      I like to make things that go on the web.<br/>
      I'm a <a href="http://github.com/phillmv">software engineer</a> living in Toronto, Canada. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently run <a href="http://state.io">State Machinery</a>, a security and development consultancy.<br/>We do security audits, and we develop web apps. We're available <a href="http://state.io">for hire</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I've been putting things on the internet for over ten years. These days, I usually use Ruby on Rails and copious amounts of Javascript. I have a degree in Computer Science, and so a lot of the time I know what I'm talking about.</p>
    <p>I like cats, photography and reading about history and economics.
