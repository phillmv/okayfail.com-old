    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <p>I am really interested in documentation, and using photography to tell a story and express emotions. At present, most of my work is currently focussed around friends and family.</p>
    <p>I keep an <a href="http://instagram.com/phillmv">instagram feed</a> I update fairly regularly, and a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hiffy">flickr account</a> where I put up photographs not taken on my cellphone.
    </p>
    <p>I have yet to assemble a proper portfolio, but in the meantime please enjoy the following sets:

    <p>I spent many years living with my maternal grandparents and in many ways they were my primary role models. Unfortunately, when we moved to Canada I only saw them once a year.</p>
    <p>I became acutely aware of how little time we had left together, and eventually I started taking pictures whenever I go back. I have a set for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hiffy/sets/72157611843468619/">2008</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hiffy/sets/72157622887518135/">2009</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hiffy/sets/72157625508185423/">2010</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hiffy/sets/72157627561600479/">my grandmother's funeral</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hiffy/sets/72157628568137675/">2011</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hiffy/sets/72157630265307024/">summer 2012</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hiffy/sets/72157632384745614/">2012</a>.

    <p>In early 2012, we discovered that my grandfather Diamantino had a terminal form of liver cancer.</p> 
    <p>At first, we didn't tell him about it. It was hard.</p>

      My friend Chris is a linguistics graduate student and otherwise extremely great.</p>
    <p>
      I followed him around for an afternoon as he conducted an experiment in his lab.
