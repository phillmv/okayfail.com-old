Back in December 2011, I was approached by [Michael Joffe](http://mwjoffe.tumblr.com/) to make something happen for the early 2012 installment of his [dance party art things](http://www.thegridto.com/life/society/the-nocturne-back-in-the-new-york-groove/), Oui Paris. 

Michael wrote about it [here](http://mwjoffe.tumblr.com/post/16653348653/instagram-music-visualizer). The folks at the [Brockton Collective](http://brocktoncollective.com/) were awesome and created a timelapse of the whole thing:

<br/>

Unfortunately, it didn't capture me [drunkenly climbing a ladder](http://instagram.com/p/lV_V7/) in order to troubleshoot it. (Here is more proof that [I was there](http://instagram.com/p/lUq-X/)).

Michael longed for something deeply interactive; although we initially wanted something that would directly engage with the crowd, we eventually settled on a live instagram feed and the rest was covered in [NOW Magazine](http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=184963).

<blockquote>In order to do so, the organizers have implemented an interactive element that they’ve deemed “the world’s first Instagram music visualizer”. With the help of developer Phillip Mendonça-Vieira, they’ve created a display wall that will project partygoer’s pictures in real time, in the ersatz nostalgic haze of the Instagram photo app. All you need to participate is a smart phone[^yayinsta].

“Instagram has become a huge part of sharing life experiences… and in a way it tells much more of a story than a status update,” Joffe explains. “So with this party we wanted to do an experiment wherein a tool that is used to share experiences becomes the reason for the event itself.”
</blockquote>


The event was a success; apparently something like 400 people showed up[^instatruefact] on a [cold January night](http://instagram.com/p/lV7hv/). The whole thing ended up being one of the coolest things I've done to date. 

[Most](http://instagram.com/p/lUud_/) [importantly,](http://instagram.com/p/lW80X/) [people](http://instagram.com/p/lXoWc/) [seem to](http://instagram.com/p/lXXOZ/) [have had](http://instagram.com/p/lX2hv/) [a good](http://instagram.com/p/lXUZ3/) [time](http://instagram.com/p/lVoKX/).

<h2>What did it look like?</h2>

There are some two or three other 3D transition animations that are not shown.

The reason I am writing about this now, in 2013, is because I never got around to making the above recording until July of this year. I waited too long, and now the original party photos are no longer the only things tagged with #ouparis[^instaarcheology], but it should still be illustrative of the overall effect.

[^yayinsta]: It was the beginning of 2012; instagram had only somewhat recently become a thing and it was cool and exciting and and no one thought it was going to be worth one billion dollars.

[^instatruefact]: Per the [Brockton Collective's coverage](http://brocktoncollective.com/oui-paris-event-coverage/).

[^instaarcheology]: I love this shit, fragments of time stored away.
