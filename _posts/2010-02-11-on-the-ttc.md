<h1>On the TTC, and the nature of large organizations.</h1>

Most people have little to no conception of how a large organization operates. I think this is extremely unfortunate, partly because I find large organizations to be anthropologically interesting, but primarily because in modern society we are constantly exposed to them in one way or another.

Allow me to illustrate with an anecdote.

My university's Computer Science department allows its undergraduates to pursue a thesis (in effect, an independent study), in lieu of attending two full courses. I was chatting with an acquaintance of mine the other day when I casually mentioned how awesome I think thesis' are. He sighed, and told me that the department had denied him access. Although he managed to find a faculty member willing to advise him, and waive the GPA requirements he didn't meet, the department administrative assistant had other ideas. She told him that not only did he not qualify, without taking a few other courses, but that she would do everything in her power to prevent him from doing a thesis.

Why the hell would she say that?, I asked him. He shrugged. He figured it was yet another way for our university to bleed him for tuition money; the only way he could make it right was by taking a number of required courses during the summer. He left it at that and gave up on pursuing a thesis.
