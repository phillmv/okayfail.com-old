<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> so<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> I was at a party on… saturday<br/>


<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> at your house/


<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> no no<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> we're all sitting around

<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> what?

<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> I'm telling you a story sheesh

<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> ohhh<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> ok

<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> i'm setting up the cinema display for the movie

<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> go go go

<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> and I forget the exact comment but it was something like<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> "oh well, but isn't Anna the only one here with a job?" (her bf, Luke, is unemployed)<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> &lt;&lt; uncomfortable silence &gt;&gt;<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> "Well tons of people have jobs. Uh… doesn't Mina have a job?"<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> (there are like ten people sitting in this room)<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> and I thought about it<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> I think every person in that room was [underemployed](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economy-lab/daily-mix/as-jobless-levels-surge-a-lost-generation/article1889998/)<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> ([Mina is a freelance editor](http://www.minasewellmancuso.com/) and so has large bouts of idleness as it commonly happens)<br/>

<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> how do they make rent<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> [that's our generation for you](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/07/youth-unemployment?fsrc=rss&?fsrc==scn/tw/eecon/sf/freeex)

<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> and I thought to myself, what [a typical generation Y conversation](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/business/economy/07generation.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all)

<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> ther'es an inkling of a feeling in me that somehow feels there's something good there though<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> [our generation isn't just fodder for the corporate machiens](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1640395,00.html)

<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> we don't settle as easily

<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> or something<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> ya

<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> Luke is borrowing money from his mom to make ends meet<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> but when telling me about the places he's waiting to hear back from, he was happy that they all seemed cool

<span class="sans-bold">andrew:</span> and i don't think our gen is just pissing it all away and wasting time

<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> well<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> I certainly am<br/>
<span class="sans-bold">phill:</span> I suspect so are most
