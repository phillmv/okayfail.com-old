Let's talk about the tech economy.

There's this [great piece by James Somers](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/living-together/james-somers-web-developer-money/) where he talks about the privilege and accompanying struggle of working as a software developer. To quote,

>I didn’t think finding good work would be this easy. I always figured I would end up like my sister. My sister set academic records in high school and studied at the University of Chicago but the only position matching her qualifications, when she came out of school, was a job translating airline menus. She had an especially bright and sensitive mind, but no technical specialty; and the market did what it's wont to do to people like that.

>I remember one time at dinner she had asked my dad, who was something of a corporate bigshot: ‘You always talk about the value of hard work. But what about somebody in a coal mine — wouldn’t you say he works as hard as you? Why should you get paid so much more than that guy?’

[...]

>It’s as if the basic structure of this sector of the global economy has been designed for my benefit.

I've looked around and felt the same way, and lot of the time I feel grateful but most of the time it makes me uncomfortable. 

It's uncomfortable to watch your less technically able friends [fall into underemployment](http://okayfail.com/2011/people-try-to-put-us-down.html), and for a field with a strong meritocratic mythos, it's uncomfortable to know the extent to which invisible, unknowable forces were determining so much of my life. I graduated right at the beginning of Great Recession. It's hard to remember now but things felt a little bleak at the time.

So, what's going on here?

James mentions cheap start up costs against the backdrop of limited labour supply.

why is this even possible? 

look at labour inelasticity http://cra.org/resources/crn-archive-view-detail/2012_taulbee_survey/ - actual production numbers are down 40% from bubble years, and 45% if you account for population growth.

rising interest rates http://www.cnbc.com/id/100814973

rising enrollment - but total output still below pre bubble years http://cra.org/govaffairs/blog/2013/03/taulbeereport/

So, what's a good causal narrative for what's going on here?


I've been reading Mark Blyth's '[Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea](http://www.amazon.com/Austerity-The-History-Dangerous-Idea/dp/019982830X)', and I think it's a genuinely great book above and beyond the fact that I agree with its politics. It reads like an angry rant and in the process of setting up his argument he provides you with a great survey of classical economic thought[^1]. As a bonus, as he provides a really tight, somewhat-more-technical overview of the [2008 financial crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308).

If you don't have much time, set aside an hour for [this talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=JQuHSQXxsjM). It's worth it for his Scottish accent alone.

His thesis goes something like this. Contemporary austerity politics constitute the greatest bait and switch in human history because – although we call them a '[sovereign debt crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_sovereign-debt_crisis)' – with the exception of Greece, they are all private banking crisis' that were bailed by their sovereigns and thus converted into public problems. How did these banking crisis' occur?

There are many valid causal narratives but he focusses on one mechanism in particular. So, there are these "[repo markets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement)" where companies lend directly to each other for short periods of time to cover stuff like payroll liabilities. The way these work is by guaranteeing these short loans with some kind of ultra safe asset. Problem was, at the turn of the aughts safe assets were drying up as all available US Treasury Bills were being consumed up by Asian governments. As a result, people found themselves starting to trade mortgage securities perceived as safe. As people ran out of more mortgages to securitize, the incentives on doing that got screwy and things exploded as it all got more abstract and fucked up and you should know the rest of the story.


So. He has this part where he talks about how this huge insatiable demand for mortgages drove housing prices in the US up by 70% and in Ireland by 170% and this got me thinking - how can we apply this understanding to the tech market?

About two years ago, we began talking about [the new tech bubble](http://www.economist.com/node/18681576) whose exburance supposedly [came to a halt](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/01/2012-year-tech-bubble-numbers/60517/) when [Zuckerberg priced his IPO to benefit himself and not his investment bank](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/03/11/where-banks-really-make-money-on-ipos/).


haven't average valuations been increasing (until recently, as it seems vc appetite has dried up) like, by a lot?

LETS TALK ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE DRIVE THESE APETITES.a lot of forces have an effect on us even if we can't see them.

inequity of the vc market - why have interest rates gone up?

what drives vc appetite?

[^1]: Okay, so one here's an interesting takeaway. Basically, we've got some pretty good ideas on how people ought to behave when they exchange things with one another and we've built great models of this but when it comes to the Big Picture The Economy eh, we don't really understand what's going on there. We've decided on a handful of correlative variables we now obsessively track and we have lots of theories on how things ought to work but it's still up for debate. Oh and we're not totally sure how money works either.

    THE REASON THIS IS SO FASCINATING is because in my mind you're trying to create models and abstractions that describe phenomena that only exists inside people's heads yet behaves by its own set of rules but that is neither here nor there.

    Here's the point that Blyth actually goes on about. It turns out people also disagree about what drives growth in the economy and there are roughly two main schools of thought: savings and consumption. A long list of people starting right with Smith say, "It is the entrepreneur who saves his income that has anything to invest later one. Parsimony seems to drive investment, people need to save more". Keynes comes along and says, "Well, why open a factory if you've got no one to sell to? Demand for stuff is what drives investment, people need to spend more". 

    So here's the rub. These two views *implicitly encode preferences for income distributions*. If you side with classical economic thought, you want to protect people with savings. If you side with Keynes, directly giving people so they can buy things with it is the best way to get out of a slump.

    Of course, that's a false dichotomy and it's more of a gradient between the two but I barely know what I'm talking about (read [the book](http://www.amazon.com/Austerity-The-History-Dangerous-Idea/dp/019982830X) yourself). It did kind of confirm a growing suspicion of mine from years of reading economics blogs and semi-pop econ books. Economics embeds a lot of distinctly *political* ideas in their arguments carefully hidden under the objective sheen of their formalisms.

[^2]: There are many valid causal narratives. Blyth acknowledges this. This is just one of them.
