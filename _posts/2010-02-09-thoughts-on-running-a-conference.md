<h1>Thoughts on running a (software engineering) conference</h1>

* Get a good night's sleep the day before the conference. If you're doing a good job you will barely sleep at all for the rest of the conference.

* Naps in hotel lobbies are a great way to spend superfluous lunch hours.

* It sucks to cut off a great speaker because you're running out of time. Try to massage the time limit into them.
 
* Get everything that needs to be printed finished at least a week before the conference start (unless you possess some deep love of frantic all nighters).
 
* The time in between talks is not the best opportunity to expose people to your taste in indie electro pop anarcho vegan grindcore. Keep it simple. ([D'oh!](http://twitter.com/KaitlinMS/statuses/8042317805))

* Competent and responsible people are worth their weight in gold. Knowing someone's got your back is an *awesome* feeling.
 
* What comes off as an asshole over email can easily turn out to be shy and extremely busy in person. Mind you, I still think, uh, what [Sirius Black](http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=If+you+want+to+know+what+a+man's+like,+take+a+good+look+at+how+he+treats+his+inferiors,+not+his+equals.&btnG=Search&meta=&aq=f&oq=) once said still applies.
  
* People have an absolutely astonishing capacity to not respond to emails. This was the most stunning thing I learned while organizing the conference. That was probably n√§ive of me.

* Emails are informationally porous. No one actually bothers to *read* them. If there is anything they need to remember, say it within two or three paragraphs. 
 
 * Distribute lots of power bars throughout the conference. I learned this at <a href="http://futureruby.com">FutureRuby</a> and [RubyFringe](http://rubyfringe.com) but completely forgot come D-Day.
 
* Hotel internet just sucks. It's almost worth selecting a venue on this basis alone.

* Nerds need to be coached into any social event. You have to force them to interact in some way. I occasionally still suffer from nerd-social-paralysis, but it's easy to forget when you've been wired for a week, constantly talking to dozens of people. 

* On a related note, students find $7 drinks morally obscene.
 
* If you're giving away stuff in a raffle, write the damn randomizing script ahead of time.
 
* Always get your speaker's contact details and travel information beforehand. Due to the efforts of my excellent coworkers, the only time I had to worry was when a speaker checked in a day late.
  
* The day after the conference can be brutal for some people. You go from being relatively important and receiving dozens of emails a day to a nobody the second the conference is over. After you physically recover, schedule some pleasant evenings with the friends you've been neglecting.
