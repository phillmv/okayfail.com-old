A lot of what we think we know about the past becomes murky once we begin to think about our historiography more carefully. 

In other words, how do we know what we know about the past?

Despite how it might have felt while reading a highschool history textbook, we have a remarkably shallow field of sources to account for of all sorts of history we take for granted. For instance, the last person who knew how to read Egyptian hieroglyphs was dead by the 5th century AD. For well over a thousand years all direct knowledge of ancient Egyptian culture was totally inacessible until a French soldier stumbled upon the [Rosetta Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone). 


As it turns out, we have a limited understanding of the condition of the average member of ancient Rome, because so much of what we know about that time period is limited to [the writing produced by its aristocracy](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2012/01/09/120109crat_atlarge_kirsch). It's literally as if the only surviving accounts of our current society were written exclusively by members of the 1%.

One of the major obstacles with filming the movie *Downfall* involved the fact that we have almost no [recordings of how Hitler sounded in casual conversation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustaf_Emil_Mannerheim#Visit_by_Adolf_Hitler).

History is fragile and what we know can be surprisingly precarious.

People evolved to love narratives. For the most part, narrative building is an excellent cognitive skill that has served us well. Unfortunately, this predisposition also blinds us to the short comings of the available

we only know what the hieroglyphs say because of the rosetta stone
there's a strong theory that the story of exodus is a babylonian slave escapist fantasy - to a large extent none of the geography quoted existed around the time the exodus was supposed to have ocurred


one of the problems with filming downfall is that 

more recently, a mere year later we suspect that 10% of all social media revolving the egyptian revolution is now lost to us http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/a-year-after-the-egyptian-revolution-10-of-its-social-media-documentation-is-already-gone/253163/

on the plus side, this means that serendipity has an amazing ability to preserve certain things for us - but this all sets us up for an interesting thought experiment for 500-1000 years from now.

It's very easy to conceive of a total civilization collapse, or some sort of intense resource crisis that renders us incapable of accessing the internet and although we live in a totally unprecedented age of literacy, we're a very short distance away from hoisting the entirety - or at least the most significant bits - of our culture online.

the problem with this is that modern technology requires a remarkably complex supply chain that is impossible to bootstrap. Even ignoring finicky issues like generating electricity or obtaining lithium and manufacturing transistors to within a few nanometers, dealing with the software side of things as it exists right now is an immense clusterfuck that requires a (consciously or not) passing knowledge of over 30 years of protocols and arcana that is impossible to sustain without every other piece of the puzzle - i for once can't imagine doing web programming without access to google, or even without github 

So, we're sitting in the future and we've simply forgotten how to, or are industrially incapable of, accessing technology. There's an enormous maintenance cost to keeping petabytes of information online; you need data servers and megawatts and replacements parts. Once one link in that chain is gone, everything will disappear in smoke all too quickly.

As a full fledged member of the internet generation it's hard to conceive of ever forgetting anything; (I recall remarking that twitter's back tweet api policy was an almost unprecedented in its forceful way of instituting a limit) but it's far more conceivable that in another hundred generations we may have even less of an idea of what we thought about and the issues we found important because it will all vanish.

it's one thing for the archive team for preserve the contents of poetry.com, but who will backup all the youtube videos? A HUGE component of current culture. How many of those will survive?
